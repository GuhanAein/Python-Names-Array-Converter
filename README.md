# Python Names Array Converter

This Python script allows you to convert a text file containing names into a Python array format. It provides a user-friendly interface using the Tkinter library to select the names file and choose a save location for the converted Python file.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. A dialog box will prompt you to select a names file. Only text files (*.txt) are allowed.
3. Once a file is selected, the script will read the names from the file and convert them into a Python array format.
4. The formatted names array will be displayed in the console.
5. Another dialog box will prompt you to select a save location for the Python file. By default, the file will have a `.py` extension.
6. If a save location is chosen, the Python file will be saved with the formatted names array as a variable.
7. The script will display a success message if the file is saved successfully.

## Example

Suppose you have a text file named `names.txt` with the following names:

```
John
Alice
Michael
```

After running the script and selecting `names.txt`, the formatted Python array will be displayed as:

```
Names formatted as Python array:
["John", "Alice", "Michael"]
```

You can then choose a save location and save the Python file containing the names array.

## Usefulness

This script can be useful in scenarios where you need to convert a list of names from a text file into a Python array format. It provides a convenient way to automate the conversion process and save the formatted names as a Python file. It can be helpful for data preprocessing tasks, data analysis, or any other use case where you require the names in a structured format for further processing in Python.
